# Scrimba Frontend Career Path â€” What I Learned & Projects Showcase

**A monorepo that not only contains all projects from the Scrimba Frontend Career Pathâ€”but also highlights my growth as a frontend developer.**

---

## ðŸŽ¯ What I Learned

- **Core frontend fundamentals**: mastery of HTML5, CSS3, responsive design (Flexbox, Grid)  
- **JavaScript proficiency**: ES6+ syntax, DOM manipulation, event handling, async flows with `fetch` and `async/await`  
- **React + Vite**: component architecture, state/props management, fast dev setup  
- **Modular structure**: created shared logic/components via a `libs/` folder  
- **Professional Git workflow**: atomic commits, meaningful messages, structured branches  
- **Self-driven learning**: followed Scrimbaâ€™s curriculum and completed real-world mini-projects

## ðŸš€ The Projects Collection

Each folder under `apps/` is a standalone project to showcase specific skills:

- `project-01-todo` â€“ interactive task manager (state, events)  
- `project-02-password-generator` â€“ UI for secure password generation & clipboard copy  
- `project-03-instagram-clone` â€“ mini React feed demonstrating components & props  
*(â€¦add more as you complete them)*

Every project includes its own internal README covering **technologies used**, **what I learned**, and **screenshots/demo links** when available.

## ðŸ”„ Next Growth Plan â€” Transition to Mobile Development ðŸ“±

**Objective:** Expand from web development to crossâ€‘platform mobile development using React Native.

### ðŸŽ¯ Learning Goals

- Leverage existing **React & JavaScript skills** to dive into mobile development :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
- Master **React Native fundamentals**: core components (`View`, `Text`), navigation, Flexbox layouts, device APIs  
- Use key tools: **Expo**, React Navigation, emulators & real device testing  
- Build **3â€“5 real mobile apps** showcasing device-specific features  
- Integrate **native modules** (camera, location, sensors) for advanced capabilities

### ðŸ“ˆ Why This Matters

- **One codebase for iOS & Android** saves time and maintenance :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- **Hot Reloading** accelerates development feedback loops :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
- Improves **versatility**, showing skills across web and mobile platforms :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  
- In high **market demand**, React Native is tech widely used in industry :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

### ðŸ§­ Action Plan

1. Study React Native through official docs or beginner-friendly course  
2. Create 3â€“5 mobile apps (Toâ€‘Do, Photo Gallery, Fitness Tracker, etc.)  
3. Add a `apps-mobile/` folder to this repo for mobile projects  
4. Write README files per mobile project with screenshots, features, and learnings  
5. Incorporate advanced features through native integrations (camera, location)

## ðŸ™Œ Contributing

- Each project folder in `apps/` and `apps-mobile/` should include a detailed `README.md`
- Optionally add:
  - `CONTRIBUTING.md` for contribution guidelines
  - `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` for community standards
